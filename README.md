# Approximating-SDE-using-MLMC
This project visualizes and compares Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) paths at different levels of granularity using Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) simulations. It demonstrates how changing the time step impacts path accuracy and computational efficiency. The "true GBM" path is used as a reference for accuracy assessment.
